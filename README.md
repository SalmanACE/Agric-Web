	-> EJS is used to create user interface.
	-> CSS is used for design the user interface.
	-> NODE JS act as a intermediate between database and front end.
	-> MONGO DB is the main database.
	-> EXPRESS is a framework which is used to reduce manual work.

#### NODE JS 

This application is written in node js and in the pattern of MVC.

	-> [Node.js]  (https://github.com/nodejs )
	-> [Express]  (https://github.com/expressjs/express )
	-> [Mongo db] (https://github.com/mongodb/mongo )

The application uses single threading in order to process events asynchronously.
	
	-> Generate user unique id for all users when they signup.
	-> Session was created when the user login to the application.
	-> Session will notify the each process and store it temporarly.
	-> When the user log out the session, Session details will be vanished.
